Building off my previous post about **[queries](https://neilgebhard.com/blog/react-testing-library-queries)**, this post will cover another part of React Testing library: interactions. Sometimes, you need to interact with elements inside your unit tests to ensure your application is working properly. The **[User Event](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/)** library is the standard library used to accomplish these simulations. Let's look at some examples.

A common way of interacting with elements by end-users is clicking. It's a great way to test things like buttons, checkboxes, and their corresponding event handlers. Here's a way to click a checkbox in a unit test using the User Event library.

```jsx:Checkbox.test.jsx
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";

const Checkbox = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor="checkbox">Checkbox</label>
      <input id="checkbox" type="checkbox" />
    </>
  );
};

test("clicks a checkbox", () => {
  render(<Checkbox />);
  const checkbox = screen.getByLabelText(/Checkbox/);

  // simulates clicking a checkbox
  userEvent.click(checkbox);

  expect(checkbox).toBeChecked();
});
```

Buttons would be clicked in a similar fashion.

Another common way of interacting with elements is by typing. This would be important for testing things like forms and textboxes. Here's an example of typing into a textbox.

```jsx:Input.test.jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'

const Input = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <label htmlFor="textbox">Textbox</label>
      <input id="textbox" type="text" />
    </>
  )
}

test('types in a textbox', () => {
  render(<Input />)
  const input = screen.getByLabelText(/Textbox/)
  expect(input).toBeInTheDocument()

  // simulates typing hello world
  userEvent.type(input, 'hello world')

  expect(input).toHaveValue('hello world')
})
```

There are many other ways of interacting with elements. Here is the exhaustive list:

- `dblClick`
- `keyboard`
- `upload`
- `clear`
- `selectOptions`
- `deselectOptions`
- `tab`
- `hover`
- `unhover`
- `paste`
