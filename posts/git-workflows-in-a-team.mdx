## Basic PR Workflows

Here's the typical git workflow for creating a pull request when working with a team:

1. Sync with the main branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2. Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

3. Check what files have changed and what changed in those files

```bash
git status
git diff
```

4. Stage and commit your changes

```bash
git add .

# or stage specific files
git add path/to/file.ts

git commit -m 'Add feature description'
```

5. Push your branch to remote

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# first time pushing a new branch:
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

6. Create the PR. Go to GitHub/GitLab and click "Create Pull Request" or use the link that appears in your terminal after pushing.

## Common Team Workflow Commands

Keep your branch updated with main:

```bash
# while on your feature branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# or
git merge origin/main
```

If you need to update your PR:

```bash
# make more changes
git add .
git commit -m 'Address review feedback'
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Squash commits before merging (optional):

```bash
# interactive rebase last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

If your push is rejected (branch diverged):

```bash
git pull --rebase origin feature/your-feature-name
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Clean up after PR is merged:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name  # delete local branch
```

The patterns are common among most teams. The key is staying in sync with main and keeping your commits clean.
