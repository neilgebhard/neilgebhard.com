Good UI design allows you to create a user interface that is both functional and beautiful. Well-designed websites are easier to use and a pleasure to interact with. It removes obstacles and barriers to the core features of your product. Here are some small tips I've picked up along the way that are timeless and widely applicable.

# Not every link needs a color.

Inline links in a paragraph may need help distinguishing themselves as interactive.

However, if you have a list of items that are links, it is often understood by users that they are clickable.

Emphasizing with bold text is a subtle way of getting the point across that they are links. An additional hover effect such as an underline is a nice touch as well.

# Use line-height to help the reader find the next line of text more easily.

When text is small, you may struggle finding the next line as you're reading through a paragraph. You may even find yourself reading the same line twice or even skipping a line. Increasing line-height solves this problem.

Large text, such as a header, do not have this problem. Smaller line-heights are appropriate in this case.

# Keep paragraphs of text between 45-75 characters per line.

It turns out that having text ordered in this fashion makes for an optimal reading experience. Your eyes are able to absorb lines of text with more facility.

# Keep visual hierarchy in mind

Use font size, font weight, color, and spacing to draw attention to the more important aspects of your UI.

Conversely, de-emphasizing text by using lighter color is prudent. Using smaller font sizes is not advised because it leads to less readability.

To review, think twice before giving your anchor tags color. Use line height to make your paragraphs easier to peruse. Make the the width of your paragraphs short to increase readability, but not too short. And use the inherent properties of text to control visual hierarchy. Remember these small design tips to bring your UI to the next level.
