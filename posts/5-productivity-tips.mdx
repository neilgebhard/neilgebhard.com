> You can't get much done in life if you only work on the days when you feel good.

There's one big secret to being productive. You ready? Here it is:

**_Focus._**

Easy right? Okay, maybe not. Yes, focus is the Big Secret. But harnessing it is elusive.

Software development requires deep work. Deep work requires long slices of time with focus and direction.

Give yourself a chance be prodcutive by following these 5 tips.

## 1. Do things first thing in the morning

When you wake up, your mind is fresh and open. This is when your mental energy is at its peak. It’s easier to focus without the baggage of the day. _Take advantage of this time as its sacred._ Use it to learn and do complex work.

## 2. Drink coffee

It’s well known that caffeine increases focus. Coffee in general is a healthy drink. _If you process caffeine well, use it as a tool._ Drinking 1-2 cups a day is a fine amount. It synergizes well with working in the morning.

## 3. Remove distractions

Have a clean and quiet place to study and work. Silence all notifications, especially chat and email apps. _Breaking focus is costly for productivity._ It takes time and energy to bring your brain to the context of your work. Do the preparation beforehand to give yourself the best chance to have long slices of time of uninterrupted concentration.

## 4. Create a todo list

Often times, we break focus wondering what to do next. _Take time beforehand to brainstorm what to do._ Then, you can focus on doing the work and not figuring out what work you need to do. Break down big todos into smaller individual tasks to simplify things.

## 5. Use the pomodoro technique

The pomodoro technique is a proven productivity system for increasing focus and work output. This technique divides your day into pomodoros. Pomodoros are 25-minute chunks of time when all you do is work. In between, take 5-15 minute breaks. There are many apps that can keep track of your pomodoros. Doing at least 5 pomodoros a day is good, _but if you can do 10+ you’re a productivity monster._

And that’s it. These tips are general enough to apply most people. The next step is what would you like to be productive for? That is for you to decide.
