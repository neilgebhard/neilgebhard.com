Misc

    unit tests for variables

    Can catch errors passing variables to and from libraries, or transforming variables

        Typing of parameters and arguments

Broad

    Reduction of complexity

    Advantage for large codebases with many developers

Specific

    Getting errors during development instead of runtime by integrating tightly with your IDE

    Self-documenting - TypeScript makes it easier to read code by other developers by surfacing information about objects and functions. It helps with even reading your own code several months/years later.

    Intellisense - Hints given when accessing properties from objects clear and apparent.

    Well-supported - editor, extensions, libraries (React, Next.js)

Downsides?

    More boilerplate

    It takes a longer time to prototype.

    More to learn.
